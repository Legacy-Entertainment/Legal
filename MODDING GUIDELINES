Welcome to Legacy Entertainment Modding Guidelines. These guidelines are designed to help you understand the rules and requirements for creating and distributing mods ("Modifications") for our games ("the Game"). By creating and sharing Modifications for the Game, you agree to adhere to these guidelines.

1. Purpose of Modding
Modding is a way for players to enhance and expand the Game's content and features using their creativity and skills. We encourage the creation of Modifications that add value to the Game's community and promote a positive gaming experience.

2. Creation and Distribution of Modifications
2.1. Respect Intellectual Property Rights
You may only create and distribute Modifications for the Game if you have the legal right to do so. Do not use copyrighted material, trademarks, or any intellectual property owned by others without proper authorization.

2.2. Non-Commercial Use
Modifications created for the Game must be distributed for non-commercial purposes only. You may not sell or charge for access to your Modifications.

2.3. Malicious Software and Cheating
You must not create or distribute Modifications that contain malicious software, viruses, or cheats designed to give players an unfair advantage or disrupt the Game's integrity. Such activities may result in severe consequences, including account suspension or legal action.

2.4. Compatibility and Documentation
Make sure your Modifications are compatible with the current version of the Game and provide clear instructions or documentation for installation and usage.

2.5. Third-Party Content
If your Modification includes content created by third parties or other modders, ensure that you have permission to use and distribute that content. Properly credit the original creators.

3. Distribution Platforms
When distributing your Modifications, you must comply with the platform's terms of service and guidelines. Always follow the distribution rules specified by the platform where the Game is hosted.

4. Reporting Issues and Support
While we encourage creativity and innovation, we cannot guarantee technical support or assistance for all Modifications. Players should understand that using Modifications may lead to unforeseen issues or conflicts with the Game. We recommend reporting any problems encountered with Modifications through our official support channels.

5. Modding Community Standards
As a member of the modding community, you represent the Game and its community. Uphold positive and respectful behavior when engaging with other modders, players, and developers. Any harassment, hate speech, or violation of community standards will not be tolerated.

6. Changes to Modding Guidelines
We reserve the right to update these Modding Guidelines at any time. Continued use and distribution of Modifications after changes have been made signify your acceptance of the updated guidelines.
